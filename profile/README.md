## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the GitHub of the Kuper development team (service formerly known as SberMarket Tech). We are currently working on creating the leading service on the Russian e-shopping market. The service includes 3 applications, a website, 200 micro-services, as well as a PaaS, and is intended to cope with high traffic loads.
